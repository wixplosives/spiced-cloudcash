### Take it for a Spin

This project is a dashboard application designed for a hypothetical fintech firm. You can modify the components that comprise its web-based application. It's a great way to explore how Codux works.

This project was bootstrapped with [`Vite`](https://vitejs.dev).

-   Learn how to edit, render and compose apps that make use of **`React`**-based components.
-   Create components with **`TypeScript`**, **`SCSS`** and **`CSS Modules`** support.
-   Visually edit in real-time and in an isolated environment.
